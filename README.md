Figure 1: ThinKeys 23 reference layout design. Planning to offer other layout
for those who don't want ortho.

Figure 2: With ortholinear layout, it is easy to use the same PCB but omit keys
selectively for different layout. Someone in the chatroom suggested this one.

----------
Inspiration and some design from https://github.com/saoto23/pineapple60

Older xx20/xx30 models have a lot more keyboard space than T460s/T470s, so
lid closing clearance won't be an issue.
